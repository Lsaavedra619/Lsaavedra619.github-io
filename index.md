### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 part 2 (Mad Libs)  was one of my favorites because it opened up a lot of possibilities for other projects. This was the first time we were able to take and use user inputs from the terminal, and it was fun to see how I could make mad libs using them. While working on this project my mind was full of ideas on how to play code and around with user inputs to make something of my own.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 part 2 (The Hi-Lo game) was another project that I had a great time working on. This was the first time we used if statements, which I knew would be very useful from then on. Testing this program with my partner was a lot of fun, and showed me how programming could be enjoyable to mess around with to make something cool.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 part 1 (Finding Primes from Files) really stuck out to me as a significant leap in my programming prowess. This lab was the first time we accessed and read other files, which allowed us to use data from larger sources. This is the point where I started to feel like I was a competent programmer, and that I had learned all the tools necessary to write more complex programs.
